Python web scraping project
Kindly note that the html file is the one used by freecodecamp to teach web scraping.You can use the code because Jim pulled down his website(It cannot be accessed now).
for the website that I have used to test my web scraping skills, the link is in the code itself as URL. The home.html is different as I said above. You can use it if you are studying web scraping on freecode camp.
